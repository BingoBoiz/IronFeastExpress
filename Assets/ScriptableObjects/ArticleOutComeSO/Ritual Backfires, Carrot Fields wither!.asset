  headline: Druid Ritual Leads to Carrot Crop Failure!
  content: Unfortunately, the ritual appears to have had the opposite effect, as
    the Carrot fields have begun to wither and die. The resulting shortage has caused
    Carrot prices to soar, making them a rare and expensive item.
  effect: Prices for Carrots increase by 50%.
