  headline: Bountiful Carrot Crop Floods the Market!
  content: The ancient ritual seems to have worked in favor of the farmers, as Carrot
    fields are now teeming with an abundant harvest. The surplus has driven prices
    down, making Carrots a cheap and plentiful commodity.
  effect: Prices for Carrots decrease by 35%.
