  headline: Royal Council Decides to Maintain Status Quo on Deer Hunting
  content: After much deliberation, the Royal Council has decided not to implement
    any new hunting regulations at this time. The decision comes as a relief to hunters
    and merchants who feared drastic changes, but it has left others disappointed
    that no action was taken to address concerns about the deer population. As a
    result, the market for venison remains stable, with prices holding steady. While
    the debate may continue in the halls of power, for now, life in the kingdom carries
    on much as it did before.
  effect: No significant change in Venison prices.
