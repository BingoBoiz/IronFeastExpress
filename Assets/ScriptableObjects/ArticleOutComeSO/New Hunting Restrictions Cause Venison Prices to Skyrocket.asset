  headline: Royal Decree Limits Deer Hunting in Royal Forest
  content: "In response to the escalating debate, the King has issued a royal decree
    severely limiting the number of deer that may be hunted in the Royal Forest.
    The new restrictions are aimed at preserving the deer population, but they have
    sent shockwaves through the kingdom's markets. With fewer deer allowed to be
    hunted, the supply of venison has dwindled, leading to a sharp increase in prices.
    Noble households and taverns alike are scrambling to secure their venison stocks,
    as the prized meat becomes a rare and expensive commodity. The decree has left
    many hunters frustrated, but for those who can afford it, venison is now a luxury
    reserved for the wealthiest.\r"
  effect: Prices for Venison Roll increase by 60%.
