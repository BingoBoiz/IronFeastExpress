  headline: King Orders Sweep of All Fish Markets
  content: In response to the scandal, the King has issued a royal decree to sweep
    through every fish market, ensuring that any fish showing even the slightest
    signs of age are immediately removed. This action has caused a significant drop
    in fresh fish supplies, as merchants scramble to meet the new quality standards.
    With fresh fish becoming scarce, the price has surged across the kingdom. Restaurants
    and households alike are feeling the pinch as they struggle to afford what little
    is left.
  effect: Prices for Fish increase by 50%.
