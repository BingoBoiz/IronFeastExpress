  headline: Hunters Flood Royal Forest Ahead of Potential Ban
  content: Fearing the possibility of new hunting restrictions, hunters have rushed
    into the Royal Forest to capture as much deer as possible before any laws can
    be enacted. This sudden surge in hunting has led to an unexpected glut of venison
    in the market. With supply far exceeding demand, venison prices have plummeted,
    leaving merchants and hunters alike struggling to sell their excess stock. The
    nobles' debate may have sparked this frenzy, but the impact on the market has
    been swift and dramatic, with venison now more affordable than ever.
  effect: Prices for Venison decrease by 30%.
