  landDescription: Silverport is a thriving coastal city famous for its bustling
    fish markets and maritime trade. The people here heavily rely on seafood for
    their daily meals, and the port is always filled with fishermen hauling in their
    fresh catches. Locals enjoy dishes rich in fish, clams, and other seafood, and
    any chef visiting this city would do well to stock up on these key ingredients.
    However, beware of the ever-shifting market prices as rumors of scandal and corruption
    often send prices fluctuating.
