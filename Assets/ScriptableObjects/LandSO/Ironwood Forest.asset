  landName: Ironwood Forest
  landDescription: "Nestled deep within an ancient, enchanted forest, the people
    of Ironwood live in harmony with nature, relying on hunting and foraging for
    their sustenance. Venison from the deer that roam the forest is a staple in many
    dishes here, paired with wild herbs and vegetables like mushrooms and broccoli.
    Outsiders visiting Ironwood often marvel at the deep connection between the locals
    and the forest\u2019s bounty. Traders dealing in venison, mushrooms, and vegetables
    will find this land highly profitable, provided they respect the forest's customs."
