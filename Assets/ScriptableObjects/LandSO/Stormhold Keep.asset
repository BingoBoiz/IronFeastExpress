  landDescription: "Stormhold is a fortress town built upon the rugged cliffs overlooking
    the sea. The inhabitants are a mixture of warriors, knights, and high-ranking
    nobility who all share a fondness for fine dining, particularly meats like venison,
    lamb chops, and steak. The nobles here throw lavish feasts with tables groaning
    under the weight of rich, meat-heavy dishes, while the soldiers feast heartily
    to maintain their strength for battle. Stock up on meats if you plan to do business
    in Stormhold\u2014vegetables take a back seat here."
