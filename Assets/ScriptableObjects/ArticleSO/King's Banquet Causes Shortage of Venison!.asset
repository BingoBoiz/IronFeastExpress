  headline: King's Banquet Causes Shortage of Venison!
  content: The King has announced a grand banquet to celebrate his victory in a recent
    battle, and word has it that Venison will be the star dish. This news has caused
    a rush among local hunters and merchants to supply the royal feast, leading to
    a potential shortage in the market. With so much Venison being reserved for the
    banquet, the availability and prices of this prized meat could be affected for
    days to come.
